## Overview
[Universal Music Group shocked the world when its decision to pull all its music from TikTok](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2024/01/31/will-tiktok-videos-be-muted-heres-what-to-know-after-licensing-deal-with-universal-music-ends/?sh=22ce8d40537c) , a popular social media platform, hit the internet - effective on the 31st of Jan, 2024. Although this came as a surprise to many, as most videos on TikTok will now become mute, it is only a part of an age-long challenge with using copyrighted work.

Imagine a world where people can obtain the "Right to Use" a copyrighted work on flexible terms and for an agreed duration and price, which is also publicly verifiable. Never has there been a more suitable time where the "Right to Use" a research thesis, music piece, a stock photo, etc., can be authorized by the copyright holder with ease, at a profit, and for anyone.

Right To Use (RYTU) is a web3-based solution with real-world importance and urgency. The RYTU marketplace is a platform that allows copyright holders to give out the "right to use" their copyrighted work under specified and flexible criteria (e.g., duration, price, etc.) with ease by minting RYTU NFTs. This makes it easier to obtain an RYTU NFT, and a holder's claim on the right to use a copyrighted work is publicly verifiable.

The RYTU marketplace is just what the world needs right now. From the growing research/software/digital arts in North America to the Game development boom in Asia, all the way to the vibrant Afrobeat/Amapiano music in Africa, copyright holders now have a decentralized way of distributing the "Right to Use" their work on their terms, to everyone, and at a profit.

**Hackathon Solution:**
The solution currently:
- Presents a great User Interface and User Experience.
- Allows copyright holders to create RYTU NFTs (both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Standards).
- Allows copyright holders to set an offer or leave the NFT open for bidding.
- Allows users to bid for an NFT.
- Provides unlockable content (which often will be the real-world asset associated with the RYTU NFT).

**Business Model:**
- Transaction Fees: RYTU marketplace has a transaction fee ($1 and 3.5% for amounts greater than $70 - subject to change) in addition to the Lightlink $1 transaction fee.
- Royalty Fees: An optional royalty fee may apply (to benefit copyright holders).
- Personal NFT Collections: Currently, all copyright holders can create their NFTs under RYTU's public collections (RYTU-ERC721 and RYTU-ERC1155). However, for a fee, RYTU will create a personal collection for a copyright holder.
- Verification Service: RYTU will verify users and consequently their NFTs at a price, to ensure their unlockable content is valid.
- Advertisement Revenue: RYTU marketplace's home banner will also be monetized and open for advertisement.

**Roadmap:**
- Chrome extension: RYTU marketplace will have a Chrome extension (the provision for download is currently on the home page). This Chrome extension is crucial in its ecosystem as it will be a shopping cart, wallet, single-sign-on, metaverse profile, notification, and payment (fiat to token using RYTU Token) widget.
- NFT Image Generator: users should be able to generate NFT images from prompts and then proceed to mint.
- Putting our money where my mouth is: On our team, we have a developer who is also a singer/songwriter. He and several songwriters have already decided to distribute their RYTU NFTs on the platform right after launch, as this is a step in the right direction for creatives.
